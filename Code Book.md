##Raw data collection

Raw data are obtained from UCI Machine Learning repository, from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set.
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 


##Signals

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

fBodyAcc-XYZ  
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value  
std(): Standard deviation  
mad(): Median absolute deviation   
max(): Largest value in array  
min(): Smallest value in array  
sma(): Signal magnitude area  
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values.   
iqr(): Interquartile range    
entropy(): Signal entropy  
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4  
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals  
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude  
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency  
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal   
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal   
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.  
angle(): Angle between to vectors.  

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean  
tBodyAccMean  
tBodyAccJerkMean  
tBodyGyroMean  
tBodyGyroJerkMean  


##Data transformation

The *run_analysis.R* script creates a tidy data set by performing the steps described in the project.

###Merging training and test sets
Activity and subject ids ("y_train.txt", "y_test.txt", "subject_train.txt", "subject_test.txt") were added as two new columns in test and training data sets. Test and training data sets ( "X_train.txt", "X_test.txt"), are merged into one data set named *Set*. Variables are labelled with the correct names taken from "features.txt". 

###Extracting mean and standard deviation variables
From the merged data set only columns with the mean and standard deviation are extracted (columns with labels that contain "mean" or "std") and saved in two new data sets ( new variables – *SetMean* and *SetStDev*).
 
###Using descriptive activity names
Activity names were changed to the ones taken from "activity_labels.txt" and volunteers were given descriptive names with numbers.

###Labeling variables appropriately
Columns with names that contained abbreviated words were changed to obtain valid and more descriptive R names. All column names that contained "Acc", "Mag", "Gyro", "^t", "^f" were changed to contain "Accelerator","Magnitude","Gyroscope","Time" and "Frequency" instead (respectively).

###Creating a tidy data set
From the merged data set (*Set*) is created the final tidy data set where the mean of every column is taken and broken down by each activity and each volunteer and written in the new file *"TidyData.txt"*. The new data set called TidyData contains 180 rows (6 activities * 30 volunteers).
